In order to evaluate how well people maintain spatial orientation in VR, we use a paradigm called navigational search in which participants are placed in an environment consisting of 16 boxes, and tasked to find 08 target objects hidden in these 16 boxes.

The challenge is to complete the task in the *most efficient* way which might require them to do the task not only fast but also strategic. That is, people must pay attention on their orientation to complete the task in an efficient way!
